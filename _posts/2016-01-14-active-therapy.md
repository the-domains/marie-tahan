active therapy

_the act of physically engaging in an activity that mentally stimulates the mind creatively_

Scheduling Active Therapy for yourself **one time per week** is a must. This is an opportunity to flex your stream of consciousness brain, the part that gets swept under the priorities rug. There is something about doing this type of activity that allows your mind to be free of list-making, time monitoring and other busy work that straps your work and home life to a monotonous routine. 

Even if just for brief 30 minute stints, the release of the mind in this way is a great de-stressor and can do wonders for clearing some of the clutter in your brain that can cause your routines to become inefficient. Some say running clears the mind. For others, it is cooking. 

For me today, it was throwing my camera into my purse to shoot something visually appealing to me. I had no specific plan but wanted to stumble upon a spontaneous subject. 

TRY IT! Do it for yourself. It should be a task you add to your week just like any other. It has importance. It achieves a benefit to your whole.
