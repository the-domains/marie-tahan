> Creating an epic life requires you to Re-Define the Chaos. ~ Marie Tahan

We've been taught that the conquering of the New Year is for quitting bad habits and making good, new ones. I've always felt this was such a negative way to look backward and forward. I prefer to see the bad and good and recognize them for what they are... my experience.

Think about it. All the good & bad that happened to you last year brought you to this one moment where you can now stop, be still and figure out what you are supposed to learn from ALL of it. There's no use in feeling down about any of it. We all fail and succeed daily. The most successful people on earth... They FAIL OVER & OVER AGAIN. They've got gumption and **recognize successes as well as defeats.**

## 5 Ways to Make 2016 A Milestone of Success

1. **Putting it on Paper Makes it Real.**This is really the perfect time to be reminded of this little gem. We used to be told that announcing your goals to the world would hold you accountable and this would help you grab that goal. WRONG!!! Write it down. Put it where you can see it regularly. --- Put it on your phone home screen, computer desktop screensaver or even on a sticky note on the fridge. Make it visible, clear and obvious. Each time you see it, take 5 seconds to think about the goal. Embed that into your brain.
2. **Flip the Switch on the Present.**Really this is just another way of thinking about the old adage, "Is the glass half full or half empty?". When you look at your present situation in a business or life goal, do you think, "Gosh, I've got so much farther to get to where I wanna be,"? This is where you need to "flip the switch". This is the time when you want to recognize how far you have come! This minor change in the way you see the exact same moment can do wonders for how you feel about your plans and destination.
3. **Clear Your Mind.**When you juggle what seems to be a million things in a day, sleep is a hard necessity to find consistently. The mind has a way of getting in its own way. Brain dumps are important. Once the dishes are done, the family is tucked in and the last Facebook scan has been read, this time is your chance to get rid of the mind clutter that will keep you from good sleep. Write tomorrow's to do list down... For work, family, personal; all of it.
4. **End Your Day on a Positive Note.**Write down 3 joyful moments of each day. This tidbit came from Facebook's COO, Sheryl Sandberg. You can write this in a journal if you keep one, on a calendar or at the end of your to do list. No matter how you choose to recognize these moments, they get you stopping to smell the roses.
5. **Believe in the Worth You Bring to the Table.**You have a finite amount of time to accomplish your goals in a day, a week, a month, a lifetime. Knowing and openly acknowledging your worth can sometimes feel awkward to us, especially since we are taught that tooting our own horn is bad. I'm not saying you gotta throw your successes in people's faces or that you need to be a loudmouth, bragging fiend to force someone to see you're valuable. If you don't voice your confidence in your work, you don't stand a chance in making someone else recognize your worth. I just mean, you gotta put a value on your knowledge and expertise. Those who don't see the value you bring to the table are a waste of your energy and time.

Look out for future posts that are more in depth about EACH of the points above. In the meantime, incorporate the tips into**your goal-setting, your self-talk, your routines**. I promise it will have a positive impact on your work and home life.

Do you have specific rituals that have helped you re-define the chaos? Share them in the comments. I'd love to know what tools you use to find your focus.
