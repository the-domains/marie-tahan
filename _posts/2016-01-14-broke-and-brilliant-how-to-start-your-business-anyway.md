You've got great ideas but really... you've got one that you KNOW would be a hit, right? I mean, really. You look around and there are so many people in your viewfinder that are doing cool stuff that they love and are making $$$ from it. 

_You ask yourself, "Why can't I do that?" Then you think... "Oh, because it's not like I have all this free time or money laying around."_

**Fear is a big part of starting your own business.** If you didn't have just a bit of hesitation then you wouldn't understand what I'm about to teach you about jumping into your dream. Hesitation excites your danger receptors which directly tunes you into doing EXACTLY what you need to do first. 
> 
> Spend time and energy in thoughtful planning. 

Yeah, I know. This sounds simple but let's break this down. FIRST, get yourself an old fashioned notebook with tabbed dividers or get fancy and use [Evernote,][0] a digital version of your school notebooks. 

## \#1 //Assess your situation. You have a great idea. //

_In the beginning of one section of your notebook, write down a clear, simple description of your brilliant idea. Then take it apart piece by piece. _

* Pull the components apart and add to a single page as a TITLE
* Add the details and elements of each component on this page
* This doesn't have to happen all at once. This is a place where you can flesh out the concept. Play with possibilities. Scrap the whims that don't work for your concept.

_**NEXT **thought that occurs to you.. You're P2P (paycheck to paycheck) or just don't have a pile of cash staring you in the face waiting for you to decide how to spend it. _

## \#2  // Make a TIME List & a MONEY List - Tasks that cost one or the other, your time or your money. //

You've already begun this process. You started with writing down the basics of your brilliant idea and have a place to refine it. 

Write down all those things that cost $$ and that you need to work toward. You can start breaking each of these items down with real numbers too as you have more time. For now, keep it simple and move on to the next most important steps.

_What else can you do that doesn't require cold hard cash?_

**Who wants what you are offering?** Come on. Write it down? Who are these sorely lacking people that NEED you're thingamabobber or talent that you have to give? Where do they hang? What type of person are they? What types of things do they like to do? Where are their virtual peeps, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Pinterest?

**Who are you and why do these people care?** Yo... yeah YOU! This is your time to be honest, confident and BOLD! You gotta write that BIO. Everyone hates doing this part. For most people talking about yourself is slightly uncomfortable. _- For those who aren't in the least bit uncomfortable tooting your own horn, you will thrive here. - _Don't be shy but while writing your bio, there are a few things to remember. **1) **This isn't a resume. This is a place to share your experience and what makes you the person to be trusted to bring the product or service to those who need it. **2)** Be honest. You do You. Bringing out your personality and sharing a little about you in the bio allows your ideal customer to find someway to connect to your story but you must be truthful. Customers can smell BS a mile away. **3) **Be sure! Communicate confidently about your offering. You got this, so SHOW IT! Now for the final but IMPORTANT step **4) **Create 3 one liners that describe you and 3 one liners that describe your product. Scratch out the worst two of each and NOW you have your profile sound bites.

## \#3 // Go Public //

Before you can do this, you need to put some thought into your brand. 

**Determine your name.** Is it relevant? Is it easy to remember? Will people understand what it has to do with your offering? Can people spell it? ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fb2777ff-d7fa-498f-b7d2-94300ae41a20.jpg)

**Be Social.** Decide what social media platforms you will want to be a part of. Which channels are the right choice for the audience you determined in step 2? CLAIM YOUR NAME! Sign up and get your name. Create your profiles. You can use your one liners from Step 2\. _(See how this goes together?)_

**Be Stylish. **Spend time mulling over the look of your brand. What will your recognizable "stamp" be? Will your logo be text, fun elements, colorful, minimal? How will that incorporate into online visuals? Will you have certain colors you use on your profiles and cover photos? Can you create these big, bold images yourself using photos of you/your product/relevant images and online software? ([Canva,][1][PicMonkey)][2] Maybe you have Adobe Creative Suite already and this part is easy for you. Do you have a friend that wouldn't mind doing a trade that could help you with the graphic design?

## Are you confident that you can BE A STARTUP with your brilliant idea right now? The path to creating an epic life starts with planning, then execution. What Are You Waiting For?
