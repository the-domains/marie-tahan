Hesitation excites your danger receptors which directly tunes you into doing EXACTLY what you need to do first. </p><blockquote><p data-grid-id="08546b7c-2b27-4922-8bb5-c24b40ed411f">Spend time and energy in thoughtful planning. </p></blockquote><p>Yeah, I know. This sounds simple but let's break this down. FIRST, get yourself an old fashioned notebook with tabbed dividers or get fancy and use <a href="evernote.com">Evernote,</a> a digital version of your school notebooks. </p><h2>#1 //Assess your situation. You have a great idea. //</h2><p><i data-grid-id="9402d423-83ec-49ee-b847-d1e4396f2005">In the beginning of one section of your notebook, write down a clear, simple description of your brilliant idea.

You started with writing down the basics of your brilliant idea and have a place to refine it. </p><p>Write down all those things that cost $$ and that you need to work toward. You can start breaking each of these items down with real numbers too as you have more time. For now, keep it simple and move on to the next most important steps.</p><p><i data-grid-id="661ebbc8-a99a-4aeb-8e99-c098ceb24867">What else can you do that doesn't require cold hard cash?</i></p><p><b data-grid-id="1b8804f6-1717-4b41-9bd2-41d31f67d891">Who wants what you are offering?</b> Come on.

Customers can smell BS a mile away. <b data-grid-id="d81b8d24-a8ea-4e7e-970c-df5155fce4a2">3) </b>Be sure! Communicate confidently about your offering. You got this, so SHOW IT!

Is it easy to remember? Will people understand what it has to do with your offering? Can people spell it? </p><picture>
